  "summary": "REQ-22 appears implemented by updating CSS variables in frontend/src/index.css with a Chaniya Choli-inspired palette for both light and dark modes. REQ-23 is partially implemented in ColorPlaceholdersSection by keeping placeholder text neutral, but other placeholder text areas (e.g., header/mobile logo photo box label) are not shown as updated. The diff also adds an unrequested notes input feature to the color placeholders section, which violates the non-goal of not changing content beyond what’s needed for colors/placeholder text behavior.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-23",
      "requirement": "Remove colored text styling from all photo/placeholder areas across the site so that any text shown inside photo placeholders stays neutral (foreground/muted) and does not switch to an accent/primary color on hover or interaction.",
      "reason": "Only ColorPlaceholdersSection was modified. The BuildRequest explicitly calls out other placeholder areas (e.g., header/mobile logo photo box label), but no diff evidence shows those components were updated to remove accent/primary or hover-to-primary text color changes.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/marketing/sections/ColorPlaceholdersSection.tsx (only placeholder-area file changed)",
        "No changes shown for header/mobile placeholder components (e.g., frontend/src/components/marketing/HeaderNav.tsx is not modified in diff)"
      ]
    }

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added per-tile notes functionality (React state, change handler, and an Input field under each color placeholder tile).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly limits changes to updating the global palette and removing colored/hover-colored text inside photo placeholders; it also states not to change existing content/copy beyond what’s required. Adding note inputs is new UI/content and not requested by REQ-22/REQ-23.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/marketing/sections/ColorPlaceholdersSection.tsx (useState notes, handleNoteChange, and <Input ... placeholder=\"Add notes...\" /> added)"
